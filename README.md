House Rent Prediction(India)
Context
The spectrum of housing options in India is incredibly diverse, spanning from the opulent palaces once inhabited by maharajas of yore, to the contemporary high-rise apartment complexes in bustling metropolitan areas, and even to the humble abodes in remote villages, consisting of modest huts. This wide-ranging tapestry of residential choices reflects the significant expansion witnessed in India's housing sector, which has paralleled the upward trajectory of income levels in the country. According to the findings of the Human Rights Measurement Initiative, India currently achieves 60.9% of what is theoretically attainable, considering its current income levels, in ensuring the fundamental right to housing for its citizens. In the realm of housing arrangements, renting, known interchangeably as hiring or letting, constitutes an agreement wherein compensation is provided for the temporary utilization of a resource, service, or property owned by another party. Within this arrangement, a gross lease is one where the tenant is obligated to pay a fixed rental amount, and the landlord assumes responsibility for covering all ongoing property-related expenses. The concept of renting also aligns with the principles of the sharing economy, as it fosters the utilization of assets and resources among individuals or entities, promoting efficiency and access to housing solutions for a broad spectrum of individuals.
